# Christoffel Symbols Visualization

**Christoffel Symbols Visualtization** is an application made to visualize [Christoffel connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols). The project is an element of my bachelor's diploma *Symbolic visualizations of the Christoffel connection utilizing the Unity engine* (written in polish). Project was developed using Unity (with C# of course) but also using LaTeX and Mathematica (to display and genereate mathematical formulas of different connections).
